## What is Drogonsec?

**Drogonsec** is an open-source modular security framework written in Go, created by **Filipi Pires** and maintained by **[CROSS-INTEL](https://cross-intel.com)**.

It was built to give security professionals a single, unified tool to detect vulnerabilities across code, dependencies, secrets, and infrastructure — with AI-powered remediation on the roadmap.

Inspired by Horusec, Drogonsec is its modern, actively maintained successor with enhanced capabilities and alignment to the latest OWASP standards.

## Why Drogonsec?

| Problem | Drogonsec Solution |
|---|---|
| Multiple tools for different scan types | Single binary — SAST + SCA + Leaks + IaC |
| OWASP Top 10:2021 is outdated | Full alignment with OWASP Top 10:2025 |
| No context-aware fix suggestions | AI remediation engine *(coming soon)* |
| Complex CI/CD integration | Native SARIF output for GitHub/Azure DevOps |
| Hard to extend with custom rules | Community YAML rules in `rules/` directory |

---

## Scanning Engines

| Engine | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **SAST** | Static Application Security Testing for 20+ languages | ✅ Stable |
| **SCA** | Software Composition Analysis — scan dependencies for CVEs | ✅ Stable |
| **Leaks** | Secret detection — 50+ patterns (AWS, GCP, GitHub, JWT, SSH...) | ✅ Stable |
| **IaC** | Infrastructure as Code misconfigurations (Terraform, Kubernetes) | ✅ Stable |
| **AI** | AI-powered remediation suggestions | 🔜 Coming soon |
